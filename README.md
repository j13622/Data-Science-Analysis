# Data-Science-Analysis

In this project I analysed Kickstarter data using various data analysis/machine learning libraries in Python

I preprocessed the data using pandas and numpy, visualized using matplotlib and seaborn, used NLTK for natural language processing, and scikit learn for naive bayes, logistic regression, k-means clustering, and KNN (k-nearest-neighbors) modeling.
